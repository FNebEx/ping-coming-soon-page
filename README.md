# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page

![Design preview for the Ping coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

[Live](https://marked-wrench.surge.sh/) website hosted on Surge.

This website was made using basic HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. There is one section that I was not able to fully complete. The part where the social media icons are wrapped in in a bubble just wouldn't work out for me. I do plan on coming back to this project and fixing that. 

Also, I'm finding that I'm using the childe selector ```>``` in a CSS a lot. I think that it works well for simple things like this landing page, but when I starting making more complex sites, I'll probablly have to dithch it for something more semantic. 

One last thing, I might redo this site using Tailwind. It seems like something that it would be fantastic for.
